    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert known for its rich yet delicate layers of flavor and texture. It typically consists of espresso-soaked ladyfinger biscuits (savoiardi) layered with a smooth mixture of mascarpone cheese, eggs, and sugar, then topped with a dusting of cocoa powder. The result is a light, creamy treat that balances bitterness, sweetness, and a hint of tang.</p>
        <p>The name "tiramisu" translates to "pick me up," a nod to the energizing combination of coffee and cocoa. Often served chilled, tiramisu is both elegant and comforting—an enduring favorite that has inspired countless variations around the world.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package Ladyfingers</li>
            <li>8 ounces Mascarpone Cheese</li>
            <li>1.5 cups Cold Coffee (use good espresso)</li>
            <li>1.5 cups Heavy Whipped Cream</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons coffee flavoured liqueur (optional)</li>
            <li>Cocoa Powder (for dusting)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the mascarpone, cream, sugar, and vanilla together until stiff peaks.</li>
            <li>Dip lady fingers. Add the espresso and liqueur (if using) to a shallow bowl and dip the lady fingers on both sides (don't let them soak–just a quick dip!)</li>
            <li>Layer mascarpone. Smooth a layer of the mascarpone/whipped cream mixture on top of the lady fingers.</li>
            <li>Repeat. Add another layer of lady fingers (dipped in coffee and liqueur) and another layer of cheese mixture. Dust with cocoa powder.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Tiramisu is even better when made in advance, allowing the flavors to blend! It will keep in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.</em></p>
