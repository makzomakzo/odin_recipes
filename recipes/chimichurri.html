    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Authentic Chimichurri is a traditional recipe from Uruguay & Argentina, where it’s a staple accompaniment to grilled meats, especially churrasco (grilled beef) at any asado (barbecue). <strong>Chimichurri is a vibrant, tangy, and herbaceous oil-based condiment</strong> that brings a burst of fresh flavors to any dish. The dominant notes come from fresh parsley, garlic, and oregano, giving it a bright and aromatic quality.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup parsley (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves garlic (finely chopped or minced)</li>
            <li>2 red chilies small, or 1 red chili, deseeded and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon finely chopped chili)</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Allow to sit for 5-10 minutes to release all of the flavours into the oil before using. Ideally, let it sit for more than 2 hours, if time allows.</li>
            <li>Chimichurri can be prepared earlier than needed, and refrigerated for 24 hours, if needed.</li>
            <li>Use to baste meats (chicken or steaks) while grilling or barbecuing. We don’t use it as a marinade, but choose to baste our meats with chimichurri instead. However, you can use it as a marinade if you wish. Also, add a couple of tablespoons over your steak to serve.</li>
        </ol>

    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Adjust the chimichurri to suit your tastebuds with more or less chili, salt and pepper!</em></p>
